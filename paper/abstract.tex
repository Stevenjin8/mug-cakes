    We optimize our behavior through trial-and-error every day to get the most out of life.
    However, standard mathematical methods, such as settings derivatives to zero and solving, are incompatible because we do not have a mathematical expression for our objective functions.
    We perform a rigorous analysis Gaussian Processes to model these complex functions and offer a method of overcoming biased observations.
    Then, we apply this method to Bayesian Optimization which allows us to perform sample efficient derivative-free optimizations of continuous functions with biased observations.
    We then analyze the performance of Bayesian Optimization on cooking time and ingredient proportion in a mug cake recipe.
