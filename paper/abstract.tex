    Often, the only way to optimize something is through trial and error.
    Bayesian optimization provides a principled way of choosing which
    trials to conduct and how to interpret errors.
    We perform a rigorous analysis of the underpinnings of Bayesian optimization
    and apply Bayesian optimization to cake-baking.
