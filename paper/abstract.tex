    We optimize our behavior through trial-and-error every day to get the most out of life.
    Bayesian optimization provides a principled way of choosing which trials to conduct and how to interpret errors.
    We perform a rigorous analysis of the underpinnings of Bayesian optimization
    and apply Bayesian optimization to cake-baking.
