In this paper, we motivated why classical optimization methods such as finding
critical points do not suffice for all optimization problems and showed how
Bayesian optimization can help us maximize an unknown continuous functions $f$.
Our main contribution was presenting how Gaussian processes are a flexible model that
can handle not only noisy, but also biased observations.
On the way, we explored infinite dimensional vector space, inner product spaces, and measure-theoretic probability.
Then, we showed how to adapt the popular Expected Improvement acquisition function for noisy and biased observations.
Finally, we showcased an experiment to validate the ideas we covered in this paper.
